# TmdbMOVie dataproject
## Pandas project that analyses movie dataset
## In this project, I'll be analyzing a dataset and then communicate findings about it. I'll be using the Python libraries NumPy, pandas, and Matplotlib to make the analysis easier.
## This data set contains information about 10,000 movies collected from The Movie Database (TMDb), including user ratings and revenue.
